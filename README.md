# ~~Coming soon~~ Nope...

I'm no longer interested in Kakoune, I'm now move focus to [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix).

Here are the last design:

- [Normal](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/e43bb140f28e6cc3f41be8c7fcd67c73) ([Json](https://gist.github.com/NNBnh/e43bb140f28e6cc3f41be8c7fcd67c73)).
- [Menu](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/7a49605b2b629fa41b8709496c2ccd55) ([Json](https://gist.github.com/NNBnh/7a49605b2b629fa41b8709496c2ccd55)).

> _NOTE: I haven't applied this design to Kakoune yet, so the latest implement is different compared to the this design._
